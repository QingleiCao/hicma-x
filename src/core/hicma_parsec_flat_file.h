 * @brief HICMA PaRSEC flat file operations header file
 * 
 * This header file contains declarations for flat file operations including
 * location file reading, observation file reading, and time file reading
 * for the HICMA library. These functions provide utilities for reading
 * spatial data, observational data, and temporal data from text files
 * in various formats (CSV, space-separated, etc.).
 * 
 * The file operations support:
 * - 2D and 3D spatial coordinate reading
 * - Observation data reading for spatial modeling
 * - Time series data reading for space-time modeling
 * - File line counting for data validation
